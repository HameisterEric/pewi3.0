Wetlands historically covered 221 million acres of what is now the contiguous United States (https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Documents/History-of-Wetlands-in-the-Conterminous-United-States.pdf). Between the years 1780 and 1980, the states of Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana underwent an 85% decrease of wetland acreage  (https://water.usgs.gov/nwsum/WSP2425/images/fig02.gif). The native wetland ecosystem is a rich habitat for a diversity of organisms and provides many benefits through water filtration and retention, soil and nutrient retention, and carbon sequestration. Wetlands also hold potential as a venue for tourism, recreation, and hunting (Chennault 52). In PEWI, the benefits of restored wetlands are maximized by using Strategic Wetland areas.
