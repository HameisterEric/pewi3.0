Soil quality is important for agricultural production and ecosystem health. PEWI monitors two metrics of soil quality: carbon sequestration and erosion prevention. Soils have an immense carbon-holding capacity and can reduce air pollutant levels while providing a high quantity of organic matter for plants to use. Protecting soils can also minimize erosion, which can diminish crop productivity and deteriorate aquatic stream habitat (Lyons & Courtney, 1990; Smith, Lerohl, Messele, & Janzen, 2000).
