Corn performs best on gentle terrain with high drainage and low flooding probability.

Strategic placement can maximize your per-unit yield: Muscatine 119, Tama 120B, Nicollet 55, and Clarion 138B soils are highly productive for annual crops, while Buckney 1636 and Gara-Armstrong 993E2 soils are unproductive for annual crops.

With a conventional corn-dominated land cover, Nitrate, Yield, Erosion, Sediment, and Phosphorous vary significantly under different precipitation scenarios.

To increase these scores in extreme precipitation conditions, try switching from conventional to conservation crops.

Conventional crops also do not provide points in the habitat categories or in carbon sequestration. To increase habitat scores, try adding some perennial or native habitat. To increase carbon sequestration scores, try adding some woody land covers or wetlands.
