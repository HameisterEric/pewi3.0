Wood production is based on estimates generated using the 2007 Iowa Woodland Suitability Composite (IDNR & USDA NRCS, 2007). Yield estimates assume appropriate selection of tree species for a given location. A 30% reduction in wood production estimates for conservation forest is applied to account for differences in management.
