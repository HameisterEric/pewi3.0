Corn performs best on gentle terrain with high drainage and low flooding probability. 

Strategic placement can maximize your per-unit yield: Muscatine 119, Tama 120B, Nicollet 55, and Clarion 138B soils are highly productive for annual crops in general, while Buckney 1636 and Gara-Armstrong 993E2 soils are unproductive.

<P>Conservation corn base yield is equivalent to that of conventional corn.</P>

<P>One hundred percent conservation corn cover gives sediment retention scores above 90, and phosphorus retention and erosion control scores above 85 in all precipitation scenarios. Nitrate retention varies substantially under different precipitation scenarios. To improve nitrate retention scores in extreme precipitation conditions, try switching to perennial land uses.</P>

Conservation crops provide minimal carbon sequestration and moderate habitat points. To improve carbon sequestration scores, try adding some woody land covers or wetlands. To improve habitat scores, try adding some native vegetation.
