    Wetlands have a high rate of carbon sequestration in PEWI that applies to all land in the wetland cover type. The biodiversity benefits and nitrate reduction associated with wetland use are optimized by using Strategic Wetlands, located in flat, poorly drained areas of the watershed. Strategic Wetlands may be prairie potholes, or low spots in the left lobe of the watershed, or shallow areas along the river. As a native, high diversity, low input land cover, it provides the highest level of habitat benefits. Game Wildlife benefits from wetlands are derived from percent area of land coverage, as well as using wetland or another stream buffer in appropriate cells.
