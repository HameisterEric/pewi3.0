Goal: Reach greater than 45% mixed fruits/vegetables and cattle yields while keeping the nitrate pollution and phosphorus load scores above 80! Try experimenting with strategic wetlands and pasture type. Good Luck!
nitrateConcentrationScore*30*Planting the whole field with mixed fruits and vegetables has high yield but a poor nitrate pollution score. Maybe strategic wetlands could help!*80*none
wetlandLandUseScore*0.1*Awesome! Place wetlands on strategic wetlands to decrease nitrate pollution and increase biodiversity!*1*bird
phosphorusLoadScore*40*Consider adding pasture to areas with high phosphorus contribution to decrease the phosphorus load.*80*none
