There are thirteen soil classes in PEWI. Each soil class has its own set of properties, including percent slope, flood frequency, drainage class, hydrologic group, soil texture, Corn Suitability Rating, and taxonomic classification. The class of a soil can tell you about its physical and chemical composition, which influences its behavior and production capacity in various situations.
