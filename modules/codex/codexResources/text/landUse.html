    Fifteen land covers are available, including perennial and annual legumes, annual grains, mixed fruits and vegetables, pasture, herbaceous perennials, and woody perennials.

    For grid cells not containing part of the river, the grid cell area is 10 acres. For grid cells along the river, the grid cell area is decreased to account for the percent of the grid cell underwater. Land use for a particular land cover is calculated by the sum of the area of each grid cell using that land cover. To find percent land use, this sum is divided by the total area of the watershed and multiplied by 100.
