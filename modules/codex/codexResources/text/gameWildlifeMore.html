Game wildlife is expressed on a zero to ten scale and is calculated from six categories. Up to 1.5 points are awarded for percentage of watershed area in low-input and/or high diversity land uses, conservation annual crops, or permanent pasture. Up to 4 additional points are awarded for percentage of watershed area in high diversity land uses. The next three categories are conservation forest, grassland, and wetland. They award one point each for at least 5% area in their respective land cover. The final category awards up to 1.5 points for using a stream buffer with an appropriate land use type (conservation crop, forest, grass hay, switchgrass, mixed fruit and vegetable, prairie, rotational grazing, short-rotation woody bioenergy, or wetland).
