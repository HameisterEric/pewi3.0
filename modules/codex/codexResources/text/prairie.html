<p>The Prairie land cover in PEWI consists of a diverse mix of tallgrass prairie native to Iowa (Chennault 78). Less than 1% of historical 240 million acre extent of tallgrass prairie remains (http://fresc.usgs.gov/products/fs/fs-057-03.pdf; http://www.tallgrassprairiecenter.org/pdf/Recapturing_A_Vanishing_Heritage.pdf) In Iowa, less than 0.1% of the original 30 million acres remain (http://www.tallgrassprairiecenter.org/pdf/Recapturing_A_Vanishing_Heritage.pdf).</p>

<p>The native prairie ecosystem is a rich habitat for a diversity of organisms and provides many benefits through water filtration and retention, soil and nutrient retention, and carbon sequestration. Prairies also hold potential as a venue for tourism, recreation, and hunting (Chennault 52). Restored prairie may also be a source for valuable prairie seeds and native grasses for biomass. </p>
