<br>
<p>
People in Ecosystems/Watershed Integration (PEWI) is a simple web-based educational game

designed to provide a scientific platform for teaching, discussing, and evaluating the tradeoffs

associated with agricultural land use and management. Players iteratively manipulate land use

annually for three years in a virtual 6000 acre watershed to meet a variety of goals. The tool

computes a variety of results, including agricultural yields, soil erosion, stream pollution, and

wildlife habitat.

<p>
PEWI v2 is developed and maintained to be compatible with Google Chrome (versions 9+),

Internet Explorer (versions 11+), and Mozilla Firefox (versions 4+).
