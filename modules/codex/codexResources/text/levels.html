<p>PEWI comes with predesigned, thematic levels, ranging from introductory to complex. The N-Factor (Nitrogen) set focuses on the interaction between nitrate levels, physical features, land uses, and other ecosystem service scores. The P-Factor (Phosphorus) focuses on improving phosphorus, sediment, and erosion levels. The B-Factor (Biodiversity) focuses on habitat variety and suitability.</p>
