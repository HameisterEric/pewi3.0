  <P>Alfalfa Hay yield is based on the ISPAID equation of $$YB_{ij}[Alfalfa] = DF_{ij} * YB_{ij}[Corn]$$ multiplied by a conversion factor from tons to megagrams and with a minimum of 8.07 Mg/ha yr.
  </P>
<P>\(DF_{ij}\) is a drainage factor equal to:
 <ul>
  <li>0.028 for soils with Drainage Class values of 10-35, as well as most soils with Drainage Class values of 40</li>
  <li>0.026 for soils with Drainage Class values of 45-50, as well as two soils with Drainage Class values of 40</li>
  <li>0.021 for soils with Drainage Class values of 55-70</li>
</ul> </P>

<P>Total production is given by the product of the yield on a per-unit basis and the area of the grid cell, summed over the entire watershed. </P>
