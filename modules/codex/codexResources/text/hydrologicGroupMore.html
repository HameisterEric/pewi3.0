The following chart includes each hydrologic group as defined by the ISPAID Manual.
 <ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li>Group A	=	Soils having a high infiltration rate (low runoff potential) when thoroughly wet.  These consist mainly of deep, well drained to excessively drained sands or gravely sands.  These soils have a high rate of water transmission.</li>
  <li>Group B	=	Soils having a moderate infiltration rate when thoroughly wet.  These consist chiefly of moderately deep or deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that have moderately fine texture to moderately coarse texture.  These soils have a moderate rate of water transmission.</li>
  <li>Group C	=	Soils having a slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wet.  These consist chiefly of soils having a layer that impedes the downward movement of water or soils of moderately fine texture or fine texture.  These soils have a slow rate of water transmission.</li>
  <li>Group D	=	Soils having a very slow infiltration rate (high runoff potential) when thoroughly wet.  These consist chiefly of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential soils that have a permanent high water table, soils that have a clay pan or clay layer at or near the surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly impervious material.  These soils have a very slow rate of water transmission.</li>
</ul>
