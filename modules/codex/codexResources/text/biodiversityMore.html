Biodiversity is expressed on a zero to ten scale and is calculated from a composite score of three nested categories and two location-specific categories. Up to 1.5 points are awarded for percentage of watershed area in low-input and/or high diversity land uses, conservation annual crops, or permanent pasture. Up to an additional 1.5 points are awarded for percentage of watershed area in high-diversity land uses. Up to an additional 4 points are awarded for percentage of watershed area in native land uses. Up to 1.5 points are awarded for wetland coverage and strategic use. Up to 1.5 points are awarded for using a stream buffer with an appropriate land use type (conservation crop, forest, grass hay, switchgrass, mixed fruit and vegetable, prairie, rotational grazing, short-rotation woody bioenergy, or wetland). Biodiversity is maximized when each of these criteria is fulfilled and minimized in conventional annual crop scenarios.
