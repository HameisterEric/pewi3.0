Gross erosion is divided in two subcomponents: calculations for ephemeral gully erosion and calculations based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) for rill and interrill erosion (p. 44). Ephemeral gully erosion is modeled through a modification to USDA NRCS estimates of 6.7 Mg/ha for Iowa, increased by 50% to 10.1 Mg/ha for conventional annual row-crops and decreased by 50% to 3.4 Mg/ha for conservation annual row-crop practices. This is directionally consistent with current understanding of the relationship between conservation practices and ephemeral gully erosion (p. 44).

The RUSLE rill and interrill calculation is expressed as A = R*K*LS*C*P, where A is the estimated net soil loss, R is the erosivity factor, K is the soil erodibility factor, L is the slope length factor, S is the slope steepness factor, C is the cover-management factor, and P is the supporting practices factor (ars.gov). The R-factor estimates the influence of climate on erosion. In PEWI, the R-factor varies according to changes in precipitation (Renard and Freimund 1994). The K-factor, representing the tendency of soil to become displaced through erosion, is dependent on soil type and is provided by ISPAID (ISU, 2010). The relationship between L and S is estimated by an NRCS graph depicting slope length as a function of slope grade (technical note 9). C-factor values are based on estimates for the Squaw Creek Watershed in central Iowa (Wendt, 2007), which depends on current and prior land use. P-factor is the product of a contour subfactor and a terrace subfactor, where contouring and terracing is assumed for conservation corn and soybean on slopes above 2%. The P-factor is estimated according to the USLE Erosion Prediction guidelines, using median row grades, low ridge or oriented roughness height, 10 year EI (storm intensity) equal to 80, and maximum recommended terrace interval spacing (p. 44-46). The gross erosion in PEWI ranges from 1.36*102 Mg/year to 1.1*105 Mg/year.
