Soybeans are an annual legume crop traditionally used for oil, animal feed, soyfoods, and industrial products. As legumes, they fix nitrogen (N\(_2\)) from the atmosphere, converting it into plant-available ammonia (NH\(3\)). Soybeans are currently the second-most planted field crop in the US, with 77.5 million acres of soybeans planted every year (USDA ERS). In PEWI, conventional soybean land cover assumes conventional tillage and management in alignment with ISPAID specifications.
