Yields are based on modifications to Corn Suitability Rating, determined by the CSR2 from Iowa State University. The CSR2 assigns a corn suitability rating to each soil type in Iowa, and this data is incorporated into PEWI grid cells. Yields from other crops are estimated as a proportion of corn yield values.
