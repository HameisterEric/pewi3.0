(General) The biodiversity indicator presents a relative measure of how well a landscape pattern maintains habitat suitability at the watershed scale for native species, based on landscape configuration and composition.  According to Fischer, Lindenmayer, and Manning (2006), native vegetation and similar vegetation structures support high biodiversity. Biodiversity is important for maintenance of water quality and for biocontrol, including suppression of pests that decrease crop production (Robertson et al., 2014; Costamagna and Landis, 2006).
