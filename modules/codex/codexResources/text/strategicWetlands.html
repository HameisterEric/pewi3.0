<p>There are twenty strategic wetlands in PEWI. These include “prairie potholes” in the lower lobe of the watershed that are prone to flooding, but have poor drainage, and shallow areas along the river or a tributary that would regularly have high moisture content in the soil. Utilizing strategic wetlands by planting Wetland in these areas leads to a significant increase in ecological services.</p>

<p>Wetlands including prairie pothole wetlands and stream buffer wetlands provide native habitat for amphibians, invertebrates, and birds including ring-necked pheasants and mallards (pp. 26, 30), increasing biodiversity and game wildlife services. It also curbs nitrate pollution; for subwatersheds with at least one strategic wetland, nitrate pollution is cut by 52% (Chennault Table 8).</p>
