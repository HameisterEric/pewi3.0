Wetlands historically covered 221 million acres of what is now the contiguous United States.<sup>[1]</sup> Between the years 1780 and 1980, the states of Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana underwent an 85% decrease of wetland acreage.<sup>[2]</sup> The native wetland ecosystem is a rich habitat for a diversity of organisms and provides many benefits through water filtration and retention, soil and nutrient retention, and carbon sequestration. Wetlands also hold potential as a venue for tourism, recreation, and hunting (Chennault 52). In PEWI, the benefits of restored wetlands are maximized by using Strategic Wetland areas.
