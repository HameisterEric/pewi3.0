The Corn Grain yield in PEWI assumes high-level management, and no difference between yield in conventional and conservation systems. Corn grain yield is based on the ISPAID equation of \(YB_{ij}[Corn] = (1.6 * CornSuitabilityRating) + 80\), and multiplied by a conversion factor of 0.0254 Mg/bu. Total production is given by the product of the yield on a per-unit basis and the area of the grid cell, summed over the entire watershed.
