<p>Mixed fruit and vegetables perform best on fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.</p> 

<p>Strategic placement can maximize your per-unit yield: Buckney 1636, Downs 162D2, Nodaway 220, Ackmore-Colo 5B, Muscatine 119, and Gara-Armstrong 993E2 soils are highly productive for mixed fruit and vegetables, while all other soils are less than half as productive.</p>

<p>With a mixed fruit and vegetable land cover, Erosion Control, and Nitrate, Phosphorus, and Sediment Retention vary significantly under different precipitation scenarios. Yield is decreased in wet years.</p>

<p>To increase these scores in extreme precipitation conditions, try switching to perennial or conservation crops.</p>

<p>As a collection of row crops, the mixed fruit and vegetable land cover attains Nitrate Retention scores similar to those of conventional and conservation corn and soybean. Similarly, it contributes little to carbon sequestration and therefore provides no points in that category. To improve carbon sequestration scores, try adding some woody land covers or wetlands.</p>

<p>As a high-input, high diversity land cover, mixed fruit and vegetables provide moderate points in biodiversity and high points in game wildlife.</p>
