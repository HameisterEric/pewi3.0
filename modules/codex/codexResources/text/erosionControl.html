The Erosion Control module is based on guidelines from the 2004 Iowa Phosphorus Index. Gross Erosion is the soil loss per year from ephemeral gully erosion, rill erosion, and interrill erosion; a high gross erosion corresponds to a low erosion control, and low gross erosion to a high erosion control. Excessive soil erosion has been shown to decrease soil and water quality, leading to diminished crop productivity and deterioration of aquatic stream habitat (Lyons & Courtney, 1990; Smith, Lerohl, Messele, & Janzen, 2000).
