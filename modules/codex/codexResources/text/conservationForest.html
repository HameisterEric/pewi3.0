<p>PEWI conventional and conservation forest land covers assume appropriate tree species selection for each soil type. Information on specific tree species is available through the Iowa Woodland Suitability Composite (2014). </p>

<p>Conservation forest in PEWI assumes management with regard to historically relevant compositional and structural diversity using a variety of strategic techniques. These may include uneven-aged management including gap or patch cuts, even-aged management including shelterwoodor crop tree release, and other techniques such as timber stand improvement, prescribed burning and/or tactical grazing, and removal of invasives (Chennault 117). It also assumes "management of coarse woody debris,  mast-bearing trees, and sensitive areas such as riparian zones, ephemeral ponds, and rock outcrops" (Chennault 117). </p>
