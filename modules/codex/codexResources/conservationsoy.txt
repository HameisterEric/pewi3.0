Soybeans are an annual legume crop traditionally processed for oil, animal feed, soyfoods, and industrial products. As legumes, they fix nitrogen (N2) from the atmosphere, converting it into plant-available ammonia (NH3¬). Conservation management assumes use of “no-till,” cover crops, grassed waterways, and/or buffers, as well as contouring and/or terracing where appropriate to the location.
