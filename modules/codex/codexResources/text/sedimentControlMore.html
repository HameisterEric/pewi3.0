Calculations were based on modified P-index guidelines(Mallarino et al., 2005; USDA NRCS, 2004a). The sediment delivery was determined as a product of three factors: gross erosion (Eij), sediment delivery ratio (SDRij), and buffer factor (Bij).
∑_(i=1)^n▒∑_(j=1)^(m_i)▒〖A_ij (B_ij*E_ij*〖SDR〗_ij ) 〗
The buffer factor is equal to .5 for land uses considered vegetative buffers: conservation forest, conventional forest, grass hay, herbaceous perennial bioenergy, prairie, short-rotation woody bioenergy, and wetland. Buffer factor is 1.0 for all other land uses (USDA NRCS, 2004a).
Information for Gross Erosion can be found in the Erosion Control tab.
Sediment Delivery Ratio is calculated as a function of drainage area. SDR for cells in the Des Moines Lobe is .044 and for cells in the Southern Iowa Drift Plain is .278 (USDA NRCS, 1998).
