<P>Soybeans perform best on gentle terrain with high drainage and low flooding probability. The conventional soybean land cover in PEWI assumes conventional tillage and no use of cover crops, terraces, contours, grassed waterways, or stream buffers.</P>

<P>Strategic placement can maximize your per-unit yield: Muscatine 119, Tama 120B, Nicollet 55, and Clarion 138B soils are highly productive for annual crops in general, while Buckney 1636 and Gara-Armstrong 993E2 soils are unproductive.
</P>
 
<P>With a conventional soy-dominated land cover, Yield, Erosion Control, and Nitrate, Phosphorus, and Sediment Retention vary significantly under different precipitation scenarios. 
</P>

<P>To improve ecosystem scores in extreme precipitation conditions, try switching from conventional to conservation crops.</P>

<P>Conventional crops also do not provide points in the wildlife habitat or carbon sequestration categories. To improve habitat scores, try adding some perennial or native habitat. To improve carbon sequestration scores, try adding some woody land covers or wetlands.</P>
