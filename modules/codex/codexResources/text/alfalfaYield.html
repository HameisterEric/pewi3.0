  Alfalfa Hay yield is based on the ISPAID equation of Alfalfa Hay Yield \(= .DF_i_j * Corn Yield\),
Where $$DF_i_j$$ is a drainage factor equal to:
.028 for soils with Drainage Class values of 10-35, as well as most soils with Drainage Class values of 40
.026 for soils with Drainage Class values of 45-50, as well as two soils with Drainage Class values of 40
.021 for soils with Drainage Class values of 55-70

Total production is given by the product of the yield on a per-unit basis and the area of the grid cell, summed over the entire watershed.
