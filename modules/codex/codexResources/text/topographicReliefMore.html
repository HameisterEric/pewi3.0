<P>Topography influences water runoff patterns, which in turn influences gross erosion, sediment retention, and phosphorus retention scores.</P>

<P>Slope length steepness is also contingent on topography and can range from a factor of .05 to 2.20. See the Erosion Control tab for information about Slope length steepness factor and its role in erosion calculations. Topography also affects the support practice factor in erosion calculations for conservation corn and soy, since terracing and contouring are assumed for elevation grades above 2% (Renard et al., 1997), USDA NRCS, 2002).</P>

<P>The runoff factor for phosphorus incorporates Runoff Curve Numbers, which in turn depend on topographic relief. For more information on these calculations, please see the Sediment and Phosphorus tabs.</P>
