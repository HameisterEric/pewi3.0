P-Index Scale:
Very Low (0 to 1)
:  Soil conservation and P management practices result in small impacts on 
surface water resources. 
Low (>1 to 2)
:  The P delivery to water resources is greater than from a site with a very low 
rating, but current practices keep water quality impairment low.
Medium (>2 to 5)
:  The P delivery may produce some water quality impairment.  Consideration 
should be given to future soil conservation and/or P management practices that do not increase the risk of larger P delivery. 
High (>5 to 15)
:  The P delivery produces large water quality impairment.  Remedial action is 
required.  New soil and water conservation and/or P management practices are necessary to 
reduce offsite P movement. 
Very High (>15)
:  Impacts on surface water resources are extreme.  Remedial action is urgently 
required.  Soil and water conservation practices plus a P management plan, which may require 
discontinuing P applications, must be implemented.
