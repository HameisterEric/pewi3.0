<P>Switchgrass is highly adaptable to soil type. Muscatine 119, Tama 120B, Nicollet 55, Nodaway 220, Clarion 138B, Canisteo 507, and Coland 135 soils are all highly productive for switchgrass. Switchgrass is also productive on soil types that have minimal yield in corn or soy land covers, including Buckney 1636, Okoboji 90, Downs 162D2, and Gara-Armstrong 993E2 soils.</P>

<P>Yield varies only slightly in extreme precipitation scenarios.</P>

<P>One hundred percent grass hay land cover gives the maximum score in sediment retention, erosion control, and nitrate retention, with phosphorus retention scores above 95 in all precipitation scenarios.</P>

<P>As a stream buffer, grassland and low input land use, switchgrass provides points in the habitat categories. To increase habitat scores, try adding some native vegetation including wetland and conservation forest. Switchgrass provides moderate carbon sequestration benefit.  To increase carbon sequestration scores, try adding some woody land covers or wetlands.</P>
