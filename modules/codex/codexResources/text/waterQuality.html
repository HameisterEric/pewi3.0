Water quality is a salient issue for Corn Belt states and other agricultural regions. PEWI tracks three metrics of water quality: nitrate, sediment, and phosphorus. Nitrate-N concentrations in drinking water exceeding the National Regulation limit of 10 mg/L can lead to negative health effects, including blue baby syndrome ("National Primary Drinking Water Regulations," 2010). Downstream, nitrate-N loading also creates hypoxic (low-oxygen) zones in gulf regions, leading to loss of marine life (US EPA, 2008)." Sediment delivery impacts water quality both locally and downstream (Alexander et al., 2008; Iowa, 2013; Lyons & Courtney, 1990; Vache, Eilers, & Santelmann, 2002). Phosphorus loss impacts local producers who incur expenses of phosphorus fertilizer application, regional aquatic ecosystems and human economy through freshwater eutrophication, and distant scales through gulf hypoxia (Alexander et al., 2008; Iowa, 2013; Jacobson, David, & Drinkwater, 2011; US EPA, 2008).
