<P>Permanent pasture performs best on soils with excessive to moderate drainage.</P>

<P>Strategic placement can maximize your per-unit yield: Tama 120B, Muscatine 119, Tama 120C2, Nicollet 55, Nodaway 220, and Clarion 138B soils are highly productive for alfalfa and grass hay, while Buckney 1636, Okoboji 90, and Gara-Armstrong 993E2 soils are approximately half as productive.</P>

<P>Yield varies only slightly in extreme precipitation scenarios, but is much higher for rotational grazing land cover than for permanent pasture land cover. To increase yield, try switching from permanent pasture to rotational grazing.</P>

<P>One hundred percent permanent pasture cover gives the maximum score in nitrate retention, with erosion control scores and sediment retention scores above 90, and phosphorus retention scores above 80 in all precipitation scenarios. </P>

<P>Permanent pasture does not provide points in the habitat categories. To increase habitat scores, try switching to the rotational grazing land cover. Permanent pasture provides minimal carbon sequestration benefit.  To increase carbon sequestration scores, try adding some woody land covers or wetlands.</P>
