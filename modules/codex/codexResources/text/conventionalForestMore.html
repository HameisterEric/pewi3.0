  <p>Forest land covers perform best on well drained, moderately deep, or moderately wet soils, and are least productive in wet, sandy, saline, or sodic soils.</p>

<p>Strategic placement can maximize your per-unit yield: Gara-Armstrong 993E2 and Downs 162D2 soils are highly productive for forest land covers but perform poorly for annual crops. The conventional forest land cover maximizes wood yield.</p>

<p>As a perennial crop, the conventional forest land cover attains maximum nitrate retention scores. It achieves erosion control, sediment retention, and phosphorus retention scores above 97% in all precipitation scenarios. </p>

<p>Conventional forest land cover provides high points in the carbon sequestration category. To improve carbon sequestration further, include some short-rotation woody land cover.</p>

As a high diversity, non-native land use, conventional forest scores high points in game wildlife and relatively high in biodiversity.</P>
