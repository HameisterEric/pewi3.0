<p>Precipitation is based on historical annual precipitation data from Iowa to simulate climate variability. Scenarios are broken into three categories. The Dry category includes the 62.4 cm/yr scenario, with a probability of 5%, and the 71.6 cm/yr scenario, with a probability of 15%. The Normal category includes the 77.2 cm/yr scenario, with a probability of 15%, the 81.7 cm/yr scenario, with a probability of 15%, and the 87.2 cm/yr scenario, with a probability of 15%. The Wet category includes the 92.6 cm/yr scenario, with a probability of 15%, and the 114.6 cm/yr scenario, with a probability of 5%.</p>

<p>In PEWI, the level of precipitation influences water quality and soil quality metrics including nitrate runoff, gross erosion, sediment transport, and phosphorous contamination. This is because increased water flow carries a greater quantity of soil and nutrients downstream. Extremes in precipitation also decrease yield for annual crops, mixed fruits and vegetables, alfalfa, grass hay, switchgrass, permanent pasture, and rotational grazing (ISPAID, Iowa State University, 2010; Emily Heaton and Matt Liebman, Iowa State University, personal communication, 2014; Emily Heaton, Iowa State University, personal communication, 2014). Calculations for yield for each land use can be found in the corresponding yield tab.</p>
