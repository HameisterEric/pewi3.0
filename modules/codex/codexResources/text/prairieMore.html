<P>One hundred percent prairie land cover gives the maximum score in sediment retention, erosion control, phosphorus retention, and nitrate retention.</P>

<P>Prairie has a moderate rate of carbon sequestration in PEWI that applies to all land in the prairie cover type. To increase carbon sequestration scores, try incorporating woody land covers or wetlands.</P>

<P>As a native, high diversity, low input land cover, it provides the highest level of habitat benefits. Game Wildlife benefits from prairie are derived from percent area of land coverage, as well as using prairie or another stream buffer in appropriate cells. Use a diverse mix of prairie and other native vegetation to maximize habitat scores.</P>
