<P>Alfalfa performs best on soils with excessive to moderate drainage.</P>

<P>Strategic placement can maximize your per-unit yield: Tama 120B, Muscatine 119, Tama 120C2, Nicollet 55, Nodaway 220, and Clarion 138B soils are highly productive for alfalfa and grass hay, while Buckney 1636, Okoboji 90, and Gara-Armstrong 993E2 soils are approximately half as productive.</P>

<P>Yield varies only slightly in extreme precipitation scenarios.</P>

<P>One hundred percent alfalfa land cover gives the maximum score in nitrate retention, erosion control and sediment retention scores above 90, and phosphorus retention above 80 in all precipitation scenarios. Phosphorus contribution is decreased for areas with an elevation grade of less than 9%.</P>

<P>Alfalfa does not provide points in the habitat categories and provides only minimal carbon sequestration benefit. To improve habitat scores, try switching to grass hay or adding some native vegetation or stream buffers. To improve carbon sequestration scores, try adding some woody land covers or wetlands.</P>
