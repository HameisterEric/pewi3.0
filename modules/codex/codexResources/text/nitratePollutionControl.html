Nitrate pollution is a well-known public health problem that negatively affects human health when exceeding a contamination level of 10 mg L-1 in drinking water, which is the limit established in the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations.  It also harms aquatic ecosystems by depleting oxygen in gulf regions (US EPA, 2008).
