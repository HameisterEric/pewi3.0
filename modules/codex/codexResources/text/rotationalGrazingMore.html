<P>Rotational grazing performs best on soils with excessive to moderate drainage.</P>

<P>Strategic placement can maximize your per-unit yield: Tama 120B, Muscatine 119, Tama 120C2, Nicollet 55, Nodaway 220, and Clarion 138B soils are highly productive for rotational grazing and permanent pasture, while Buckney 1636, Okoboji 90, and Gara-Armstrong 993E2 soils are approximately half as productive.</P>

<P>Yield varies only slightly in extreme precipitation scenarios, but is much higher for rotational grazing land cover than for permanent pasture land cover.</P>

<P>One hundred percent rotational grazing cover gives the maximum score in nitrate retention, with erosion control scores above 95, sediment retention scores above 90, and phosphorus retention scores above 85 in all precipitation scenarios.</P>

<P>As a stream buffer, grassland, and low input, high diversity land use, rotational grazing provides the highest level of points in the game wildlife category and relatively high points in the biodiversity category. To improve habitat scores, try diversifying the watershed cover by adding some native vegetation. Rotational grazing provides minimal carbon sequestration benefit.  To improve carbon sequestration scores, try adding some woody land covers or wetlands.</P>
