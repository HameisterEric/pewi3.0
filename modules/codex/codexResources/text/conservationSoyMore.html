<P>Soybeans perform best on gentle terrain with high drainage and low flooding probability.</P> 

<P>Strategic placement can maximize your per-unit yield: Muscatine 119, Tama 120B, Nicollet 55, and Clarion 138B soils are highly productive for annual crops in general, while Buckney 1636 and Gara-Armstrong 993E2 soils are unproductive.</P>

<P>Conservation soybean base yield is equivalent to that of conventional soybean.</P>

<P>One hundred percent conservation soybean cover gives sediment retention scores above 90, and phosphorus retention and erosion control scores above 80 in all precipitation scenarios. Nitrate retention varies substantially under different precipitation scenarios. To improve nitrate retention scores in extreme precipitation conditions, try switching to perennial crops.</P>

<P>Conservation crops provide minimal points in carbon sequestration, and moderate habitat points. To increase carbon sequestration scores, try adding some woody land covers or wetlands. To increase habitat scores, try adding some native vegetation.</P>
