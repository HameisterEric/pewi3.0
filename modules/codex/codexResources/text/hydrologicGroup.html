Hydrologic groups are used to estimate runoff from precipitation. They influence runoff curve numbers (RCN) for each land use type, which are used to calculate the runoff component of phosphorus transport. Soils are classified into one of four hydrologic groups based on drainage class and other attributes such as texture (ISPAID Manual).
