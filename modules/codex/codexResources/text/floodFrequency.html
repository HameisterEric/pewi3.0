This feature shows the frequency of flooding for each grid cell of PEWI, as found in the ISPAID Soil Survey. Flooding categories are defined below, according to the ISPAID manual. In PEWI, flooding frequency is incorporated into yield calculations: yield is determined as per ISPAID calculations as a function of CSR2 results. The CSR2 formula is CSR2 = S-M-W-F-D+/- EJ, where F is the field condition including ponding and flooding properties, among other factors (Burras et al. CSR2 equation and component values). See the Yield tab for more information.
NONE	=	0	=	Flooding is not probable.
RARE	=	10	=	Flooding is unlikely but possible under unusual weather conditions.
OCCAS	=	20	=	Flooding occurs on an average of 50 times or less in 100 years.
FREQ	=	40	=	Flooding occurs on an average of more than 50 times in 100 years.
PONDED	=	50	=	Standing water on soils in closed depressions.  Unless the soils are artificially drained, the water can be removed only by percolation or evapotranspiration.  (Ponded is for short duration unless otherwise specified).
