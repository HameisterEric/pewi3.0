This feature shows the relative drainage of each pixel in PEWI. Drainage classes are defined below, according to the ISPAID manual. In PEWI, drainage class influences yield, phosphorus, and ISPAID yield values incorporate drainage class information; for more information see the Yield tab (Miller, Fenton, Oneal, Tiffany, & Burras, 2010, p. 6). The drainage component of the phosphorus delivery calculation is a function of flow factor, which is dependent on drainage class. Additionally, the runoff component of the phosphorus calculation incorporates runoff curve numbers based on hydrologic group. See the Phosphorus Tab and Hydrologic Group Tab for more information.
