Corn is an annual grain crop traditionally used for food, animal feed, and biofuel. Corn is currently the most planted field crop in the US, with over 90 million acres of corn planted every year. In PEWI, conservation management assumes use of “no-till,” cover crops, grassed waterways, and/or buffers, as well as contouring and/or terracing where appropriate to the location (downhill slopes above 2% elevation grade).
