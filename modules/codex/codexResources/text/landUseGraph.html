The first circle graph gives the percent of the watershed youâ€™ve devoted to each of the land uses. Scroll over the graph or the legend on the right to view the quantitative data for that land use. Use the up and down arrows to switch between List view and Category view. List view displays each land use individually. Category view groups land uses into seven categories: annual grain, annual legume, mixed fruit and vegetables, pasture, non-pasture perennial herbs, perennial legume, and perennial wetland. Use the arrows to switch between years.
