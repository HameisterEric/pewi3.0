Click on the abacus icon at the top of the Results page to access the data tab with two numerical tables. Both tables provide three metrics: the zero-to-100 scale used in the Scores tab, English units, and metric units. The first table gives the percent area of each land use by year, and the second gives ecosystem service scores by year. At the bottom of the page are precipitation data and strategic wetland use for each year.
