This feature shows the elevation grade, or slope, of each pixel of PEWI. Land use covers perform differently under different elevations, and the topographic map can help explain results and inform location-specific land use choices. The lightest color represents the shallowest slope, and the darkest color represents the steepest slope.

Topography influences water runoff patterns, which in turn influences gross erosion, sediment, and phosphorus pollution.

Slope length steepness is also contingent on topography and can range from a factor of .05 to 2.20. See the Erosion Control tab for information about Slope length steepness factor and its role in erosion calculations. Topography also affects the support practice factor in erosion calculations for conservation corn and soy, since terracing and contouring are assumed for elevation grades above 2% (Renard et al., 1997), USDA NRCS, 2002).

The runoff factor for phosphorus incorporates Runoff Curve Numbers, which in turn depend on topographic relief. For more information on these calculations, please see the Sediment and Phosphorus tabs.
