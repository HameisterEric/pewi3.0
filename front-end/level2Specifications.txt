Goal: Reach greater than 95% soybean yield while keeping your nitrate pollution score above 75! Try experimenting with strategic wetlands and/or prairie. Good Luck!
nitrateConcentrationScore*10*The nitrate pollution score is rather low. Try planting a crop that won't dump as much nitrate in the river!*50*Great! Conservation soybean reduces nitrate pollution levels.*70*Retaining wetlands on strategic wetlands greatly improves nitrate pollution levels!*75*none
wetlandLandUseScore*0.1*Awesome! Place wetlands on strategic wetlands to decrease nitrate pollution and increase biodiversity!*1*bird
