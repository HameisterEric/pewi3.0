Corn is an annual grain crop traditionally used for food, animal feed, and biofuel. Corn is currently the most planted field crop in the US, with over 90 million acres of corn planted every year. In PEWI, conventional corn land cover assumes conventional tillage and management in alignment with specifications from the Iowa Soil Properties and Interpretations Database.
