The ecosystem services radar plot shows the zero-to-100 score of ecosystem services pertaining to water quality, soil health, and habitat. A watershed design with high scores in many ecosystem services will produce a radar plot shape with a large area, while a watershed design with low ecosystem service scores will produce a smaller shape.
