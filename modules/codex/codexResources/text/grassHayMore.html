<P>Grass hay performs best on soils with excessive to moderate drainage.</P>

<P>Strategic placement can maximize your per-unit yield: Tama 120B, Muscatine 119, Tama 120C2, Nicollet 55, Nodaway 220, and Clarion 138B soils are highly productive for alfalfa and grass hay, while Buckney 1636, Okoboji 90, and Gara-Armstrong 993E2 soils are approximately half as productive.</P>

<P>Yield varies only slightly in extreme precipitation scenarios.</P>

<P>One hundred percent grass hay land cover gives the maximum score in Nitrate Retention, while Erosion Control, and Sediment and Phosphorus Retention score above 95 in all precipitation scenarios.</P>

<P>As a stream buffer and low input land use, grass hay provides moderate points in the habitat categories. To increase habitat scores, try adding some native vegetation. Grass hay provides minimal carbon sequestration benefit.  To increase carbon sequestration scores, try adding some woody land covers or wetlands.</P>
