In PEWI, Nitrate Pollution Control is the indexed inverse of annual mean nitrate-N concentration in surface water at the watershed outlet.  The nitrate-N contribution for the watershed is derived as follows:
∑_(i=1)^n▒[maxa〖{100*PW_i ∑_(j=1)^(m_i)▒R_ij  C_ij,2}*A_(i.)/A_(..) 〗 ] 
where i represents the watershed, j represents the pixel, P is a precipitation multiplier, Wi is a strategic wetland multiplier, Rij is a row crop multiplier, and Cij is a conservation row crop multiplier.

The multipliers can take the following values:
P = .86 in dry years; 1.69 in normal years following dry years; 2.11 in wet years after dry years; 1.00 in all other years (Randall & Mulla, 2001).
Wi = .48 for subwatersheds with at least one strategic wetland; 1.00 otherwise (Thomas Isenhart, Iowa State University, personal communication, 2013).
Rij = .14*Aij/Ai. for conservation corn, conservation soy, conventional corn, conventional soy, and mixed fruit and vegetables, and 0.00 otherwise, where Aij is the area of the grid cell and Ai. is the area of the subwatershed (Schilling & Libra, 2000).
Cij = .69*Aij/Ai. for conservation corn and conservation soy in the Des Moines Lobe, .62*Aij/Ai. for conservation corn and conservation soy in the Southern Iowa Drift Plain, and 1.00*Aij/Ai. otherwise (Iowa, 2013).
