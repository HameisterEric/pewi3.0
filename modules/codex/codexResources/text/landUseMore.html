  Upland grid cells, those not containing part of the river, are 10 acres (4 hectares) in area. Grid cells along the river decrease in area to account for the percent of the grid cell underwater. Land use for a particular land cover is calculated by the sum of the area of each grid cell using that land cover. To find percent land use, this sum is divided by the total area of the watershed and multiplied by 100.
